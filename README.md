# 4.Creating-a-Python-GUI-for-a-C-Image-Processing-Library

Summary:

IPL 98 (Image Processing Library 98)
An open source image processing library
Supports functions from simple image scaling and rotating to fourier  transforms.
2 categories - containers(used for storing images), Algorithms
The objective of this work was to create GUI for IPL, which is written in c/c++

Scripting Language

Allows for rapid development and prototyping
Can be used interactively and do not need to be compiled.

Interfacing C++ and Python using Swing

The task of interfacing or binding Python with c++ libraries can be accomplished by SWIG
Wrapping the entire IPL 98 library
Wrapping c++ functions performing specific tasks 
Modular development

The Python GUI

Requirement specification
An extensible interface
Working  directory
Image Display

Conclusions and Recommendation

GNU - Vu is a process platform image process application
It is built from a mixture of programming language.
